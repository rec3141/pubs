  Abstract                 = {A gas vacuolate bacterium, designated strain 37T, was isolated from a sea ice core collected from Point Barrow, Alaska, USA. Cells of strain 37T were large (6-14 microm in length), rod-shaped, contained gas vacuoles of two distinct morphologies, and grew well at NaCl concentrations of 1-10 \% and at temperatures of -12 to 10 degrees C. The DNA G+C content was 40 mol\%. Whole-cell fatty acid analysis showed that 16 : 1omega7c comprised 67 \% of the total fatty acid content. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that this bacterium was closely related to members of the genus Psychromonas, with highest sequence similarity (96.8 \%) to Psychromonas antarctica. Phenotypic analysis differentiated strain 37T from P. antarctica on the basis of several characteristics, including cell morphology, growth temperature range and the ability to hydrolyse polymers. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments revealed a level of relatedness of 37 \% between strain 37T and P. antarctica, providing further support that it represents a distinct species. The name Psychromonas ingrahamii sp. nov. is proposed for this novel species. The type strain is 37T (=CCUG 51855T=CIP 108865T).},

  Abstract                 = {A gas-vacuolate bacterium, strain 174(T), was isolated from a sea-ice core collected from Point Barrow, Alaska, USA. Comparative analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that this bacterium was most closely related to Psychromonas ingrahamii 37(T), with a similarity of >99 \%. However, strain 174(T) could be clearly distinguished from closely related species by DNA-DNA hybridization; relatedness values determined by two different methods between strain 174(T) and P. ingrahamii 37(T) were 58.4 and 55.7 \% and those between strain 174(T) and Psychromonas antarctica DSM 10704(T) were 46.1 and 33.1 \%, which are well below the 70 \% level used to define a distinct species. Phenotypic analysis, including cell size (strain 174(T) is the largest member of the genus Psychromonas, with rod-shaped cells, 8-18 microm long), further differentiated strain 174(T) from other members of the genus Psychromonas. Strain 174(T) could be distinguished from its closest relative, P. ingrahamii, by its utilization of D-mannose and D-xylose as sole carbon sources, its ability to ferment myo-inositol and its inability to use fumarate and glycerol as sole carbon sources. In addition, strain 174(T) contained gas vacuoles of two distinct morphologies and grew at temperatures ranging from below 0 to 10 degrees C and its optimal NaCl concentration for growth was 3.5 \%. The DNA G+C content was 40 mol\%. Whole-cell fatty acid analysis showed that 16 : 1omega7c and 16 : 0 comprised 44.9 and 26.4 \% of the total fatty acid content, respectively.

  Abstract                 = {Our knowledge about the microorganisms living in the high Arctic Ocean is still rudimentary compared to other oceans mostly because of logistical challenges imposed by its inhospitable climate and the presence of a multi-year ice cap. We have used 18S rRNA gene libraries to study the diversity of microbial eukaryotes in the upper part of the water column (0-170 m depth), the sea ice (0-1.5 m depth) and the overlying snow from samples collected in the vicinity of the North Pole (N88°35', E015°59) at the very end of the long polar night. We detected very diverse eukaryotes belonging to Alveolata, Fungi, Amoebozoa, Viridiplantae, Metazoa, Rhizaria, Heterokonta, and Telonemia. Different alveolates (dinoflagellates and Marine Alveolate Groups I and II species) were the most abundant and diverse in gene libraries from water and sea ice, representing 80\% of the total number of clones and operational taxonomic units. Only contaminants and/or species from continental ecosystems were detected in snow, suggesting wind- and animal- or human-mediated cosmopolitan dispersal of some taxa. By contrast, sea ice and seawater samples harbored a larger and more similar inter-sample protist diversity as compared with snow. The North Pole was found to harbor distinctive eukaryotic communities along the vertical gradient with an unparalleled diversity of core dinoflagellates, largely dominant in libraries from the water column, as compared to other oceanic locations. In contrast, phototrophic organisms typical of Arctic sea ice and plankton, such as diatoms and prasinophytes, were very rare in our samples. This was most likely due to a decrease of their populations after several months of polar night darkness and to the presence of rich populations of diverse grazers. Whereas strict phototrophs were scarce, we identified a variety of likely mixotrophic taxa, which supports the idea that mixotrophy may be important for the survival of diverse protists through the long polar night.},

  Abstract                 = {Fragilariopsis is a dominating psychrophilic diatom genus in polar sea ice. The two species Fragilariopsis cylindrus and Fragilariopsis curta are able to grow and divide below freezing temperature of sea water and above average sea water salinity. Here we show that antifreeze proteins (AFPs), involved in cold adaptation in several psychrophilic organisms, are widespread in the two polar species. The presence of AFP genes (afps) as a multigene family indicated the importance of this group of genes for the genus Fragilariopsis, possibly contributing to its success in sea ice. Protein phylogeny showed the potential mobility of afps, which appear to have crossed kingdom and domain borders, occurring in Bacteria, diatoms, crustaceans and fungi. Our results revealed a broad distribution of AFPs not only in polar organisms but also in taxa apparently not related to cold environments, suggesting that these proteins may be multifunctional. The relevance of AFPs to Fragilariopsis was also shown by gene expression analysis. Under stress conditions typical for sea ice, with subzero temperatures and high salinities, F. cylindrus and F. curta strongly expressed selected afps. An E/G point mutation in the Fragilariopsis AFPs may play a role in gene expression activity and protein function.},

  Abstract                 = {Diatoms are responsible for ~40\% of marine primary production and are key players in global carbon cycling. There is mounting evidence that diatom growth is influenced by cobalamin (vitamin B(12)) availability. This cobalt-containing micronutrient is only produced by some bacteria and archaea but is required by many diatoms and other eukaryotic phytoplankton. Despite its potential importance, little is known about mechanisms of cobalamin acquisition in diatoms or the impact of cobalamin scarcity on diatom molecular physiology. Proteomic profiling and RNA-sequencing transcriptomic analysis of the cultured diatoms Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Thalassiosira pseudonana revealed three distinct strategies used by diatoms to cope with low cobalamin: increased cobalamin acquisition machinery, decreased cobalamin demand, and management of reduced methionine synthase activity through changes in folate and S-adenosyl methionine metabolism. One previously uncharacterized protein, cobalamin acquisition protein 1 (CBA1), was up to 160-fold more abundant under low cobalamin availability in both diatoms. Autologous overexpression of CBA1 revealed association with the outside of the cell and likely endoplasmic reticulum localization. Cobalamin uptake rates were elevated in strains overexpressing CBA1, directly linking this protein to cobalamin acquisition. CBA1 is unlike characterized cobalamin acquisition proteins and is the only currently identified algal protein known to be implicated in cobalamin uptake. The abundance and widespread distribution of transcripts encoding CBA1 in environmental samples suggests that cobalamin is an important nutritional factor for phytoplankton. Future study of CBA1 and other molecular signatures of cobalamin scarcity identified here will yield insight into the evolution of cobalamin utilization and facilitate monitoring of cobalamin starvation in oceanic diatom communities.},

The host bacteria are psychrophilic with good growth at 0 degrees C, resulting in a rapid formation of visible colonies at this temperature. The phages showed an even more pronounced adaptation to cold temperatures than the bacteria, with growth maxima below 14 degrees C and good plaque formation at 0 degrees C. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) examinations revealed that the bacteriophages belonged to the tailed, double-stranded DNA phage families Siphoviridae and Myoviridae.

Phenotypic analysis showed that the strains isolated formed two distinct taxa. The first taxon included nonmotile, nutritionally fastidious strains that were isolated from the pycnocline of Burton Lake. The cells of these strains were morphologically variant, ranging from vibrioid to ring shaped to coiled and filamentous; in addition, the strains were unable to metabolise carbohydrates or polysaccharides and had DNA G + C contents of 27 to 29 mol\%. The strains of the second taxon, which were isolated from sea ice cores and from ice aigal biomass, were saccharolytic, exhibited rapid gliding motility, were rodlike to filamentous, and had DNA G + C contents of 36 to 38 mol\%. A 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequence analysis revealed that the two Antarctic taxa formed related but distinct lineages within the [Flexibacter] maritimus rRNA branch of the family Flavobacteriacrae. The levels of 16S rDNA sequence similarity between the taxa were 90.5 to 91.3\%, while the levels of similarity to other members of the [F.] maritimus rRNA branch were 85 to 90\%. The whole-cell lipid profiles of the Antarctic strains were mainly comprised of branched and unbranched monounsaturated C15 to C17 fatty acids. The presence of significant levels of the lipids a 15:1 omega 10c and a17:1 omega 7c appeared to be useful biomarkers for the new Antarctic taxa and for differentiating these organisms from other members of the family Flavobacteriaceae. On the basis of polyphasic taxonomic data we propose that the new taxa are novel bacterial species designated Psychroserpens burtonensis gen. nov., sp. nov. (type strain, ACAM 188) and Gelidibacter algens gen. nov., sp. nov. (type strain, ACAM 536).},

  Abstract                 = {The bacterial populations associated with sea ice sampled from Antarctic coastal areas were investigated by use of a phenotypic approach and a phylogenetic approach based on genes encoding 16S rRNA (16S rDNA). The diversity of bacteria associated with sea ice was also compared with the bacterial diversity of seawater underlying sea ice. Psychrophilic (optimal growth temperature, < or = 15 degrees C; no growth occurring at 20 degrees C) bacterial diversity was found to be significantly enriched in sea ice samples possessing platelet and bottom ice diatom assemblages, with 2 to 9 distinct (average, 5.6 +/- 1.8) psychrophilic taxa isolated per sample. Substantially fewer psychrophilic isolates were recovered from ice cores with a low or negligible population of ice diatoms or from under-ice seawater samples (less than one distinct taxon isolated per sample). In addition, psychrophilic taxa that were isolated from under-ice seawater samples were in general phylogenetically distinct from psychrophilic taxa isolated from sea ice cores. The taxonomic distributions of psychrotrophic bacterial isolates (optimal growth temperature, > 20 degrees C; growth can occur at approximately 4 degrees C) isolated from sea ice cores and under-ice seawater were quite similar. Overall, bacterial isolates from Antarctic sea ice were found to belong to four phylogenetic groups, the alpha and gamma subdivisions of the Proteobacteria, the gram-positive branch, and the Flexibacter-Bacteroides-Cytophaga phylum. Most of the sea ice strains examined appeared to be novel taxa based on phylogenetic comparisons, with 45\% of the strains being psychrophilic. 16S rDNA sequence analysis revealed that psychrophilic strains belonged to the genera Colwellia, Shewanella, Marinobacter, Planococcus, and novel phylogenetic lineages adjacent to Colwellia and Alteromonas and within the Flexibacter-Bacteroides-Cytophaga phylum. Psychrotrophic strains were found to be members of the genera Pseudoalteromonas, Psychrobacter, Halomonas, Pseudomonas, Hyphomonas, Sphingomonas, Arthrobacter, Planococcus, and Halobacillus. From this survey, it is proposed that ice diatom assemblages provide niches conducive to the proliferation of a diverse array of psychrophilic bacterial species.},

  Abstract                 = {A group of sea-ice-derived psychrophilic bacterial strains possessing the unusual ability to synthesize the polyunsaturated fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5 omega 3) and arachidonic acid (20:4 omega 6) belong to the Family Flavobacteriaceae (Flexibacter-Bacteroides-Flavobacterium phylum), according to 16S rRNA sequence analysis. Surprisingly, the isolates were also found to cluster closely to the moderately halophilic and psychrotrophic species [Flavobacterium] gondwanense (sequence similarity 97.8-98.1\%). The whole-cell fatty acid profiles of this group and [Flavobacterium] gondwanense were very similar and distinct from other related flavobacteria. The sea ice strains and [Flavobacterium] gondwanense differed substantially in terms of ecophysiology, possibly representing divergent adaptations to sympagic and planktonic marine habitats, respectively. Evidence based on phylogeny and fatty acid profiles supports the conclusion that the taxa are close relatives distinct from other bacterial groups. It is thus proposed that the sea ice strains represent a novel taxon designated Psychroflexus torquis gen. nov., sp. nov. (type strain ACAM 623T) while [Flavobacterium] gondwanense becomes Psychroflexus gondwanense gen. nov., comb. nov.},

  Abstract                 = {Newly formed sea ice is a vast and biogeochemically active environment. Recently, we reported an unusual microbial community dominated by members of the Rhizobiales in frost flowers at the surface of Arctic young sea ice based on the presence of 16S gene sequences related to these strains. Here, we use metagenomic analysis of two samples, from a field of frost flowers and the underlying young sea ice, to explore the metabolic potential of this surface ice community. The analysis links genes for key biogeochemical processes to the Rhizobiales, including dimethylsulfide uptake, betaine glycine turnover, and halocarbon production. Nodulation and nitrogen fixation genes characteristic of terrestrial root-nodulating Rhizobiales were generally lacking from these metagenomes. Non-Rhizobiales clades at the ice surface had genes that would enable additional biogeochemical processes, including mercury reduction and dimethylsulfoniopropionate catabolism. Although the ultimate source of the observed microbial community is not known, considerations of the possible role of eolian deposition or transport with particles entrained during ice formation favor a suspended particle source for this microbial community.},

  Abstract                 = {Frost flowers are highly saline ice structures that grow on the surface of young sea ice, a spatially extensive environment of increasing importance in the Arctic Ocean. In a previous study, we reported organic components of frost flowers in the form of elevated levels of bacteria and exopolymers relative to underlying ice. Here, DNA was extracted from frost flowers and young sea ice, collected in springtime from a frozen lead offshore of Barrow, Alaska, to identify bacteria in these understudied environments. Evaluation of the distribution of 16S rRNA genes via four methods (microarray analysis, T-RFLP, clone library and shotgun metagenomic sequencing) indicated distinctive bacterial assemblages between the two environments, with frost flowers appearing to select for Rhizobiales. A phylogenetic placement approach, used to evaluate the distribution of similar Rhizobiales sequences in other polar marine studies, indicated that some of the observed strains represent widely distributed members of the marine rare biosphere in both the Arctic and Antarctic.},

  Abstract                 = {Microbial communities associated with Arctic fjord ice polluted with petroleum oils were investigated in this study. A winter field experiment was conducted in the Van Mijen Fjord (Svalbard) from February to June 2004, in which the ice was contaminated with a North Sea paraffinic oil. Holes were drilled in the ice and oil samples frozen into the ice at the start of the experiment. Samples, including cores of both oil-contaminated and clean ice, were collected from the field site 33, 74, and 112 days after oil application. The sampled cores were separated into three sections and processed for microbiological and chemical analyses. In the oil-contaminated cores, enumerations of total prokaryotic cells by fluorescence microscopy and colony-forming units (CFU) counts of heterotrophic prokaryotes both showed stimulation of microbial growth, while concentrations of oil-degrading prokaryotes remained at similar levels in contaminated and clean ice. Analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified bacterial 16S rRNA gene fragments by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) revealed that bacterial communities in oil-contaminated ice generated fewer bands than communities in clean ice, although banding patterns changed both in contaminated and clean ice during the experimental period. Microbial communities in unpolluted ice and in cores contaminated with the paraffinic oil were examined by cloning and sequence analysis. In the contaminated cores, the communities became predominated by Gammaproteobacteria related to the genera Colwellia, Marinomonas, and Glaciecola, while clean ice included more heterogeneous populations. Chemical analysis of the oil-contaminated ice cores with determinations of n-C17/Pristane and naphthalene/phenanthrene ratios indicated slow oil biodegradation in the ice, primarily in the deeper parts of the ice with low hydrocarbon concentrations.},

  Abstract                 = {A comprehensive assessment of bacterial diversity and community composition in arctic and antarctic pack ice was conducted through cultivation and cultivation-independent molecular techniques. We sequenced 16S rRNA genes from 115 and 87 pure cultures of bacteria isolated from arctic and antarctic pack ice, respectively. Most of the 33 arctic phylotypes were >97\% identical to previously described antarctic species or to our own antarctic isolates. At both poles, the alpha- and gamma-proteobacteria and the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium group were the dominant taxonomic bacterial groups identified by cultivation as well as by molecular methods. The analysis of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries from multiple arctic and antarctic pack ice samples revealed a high incidence of closely overlapping 16S rRNA gene clone and isolate sequences. Simultaneous analysis of environmental samples with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed that approximately 95\% of 4',6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-stained cells hybridized with the general bacterial probe EUB338. More than 90\% of those were further assignable. Approximately 50 and 36\% were identified as gamma-proteobacteria in arctic and antarctic samples,respectively. Approximately 25\% were identified as alpha-proteobacteria, and 25\% were identified as belonging to the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium group. For the quantification of specific members of the sea ice community, new oligonucleotide probes were developed which target the genera Octadecabacter, Glaciecola, Psychrobacter, Marinobacter, Shewanella, and Polaribacter: High FISH detection rates of these groups as well as high viable counts corroborated the overlap of clone and isolate sequences. A terrestrial influence on the arctic pack ice community was suggested by the presence of limnic phylotypes.},

Members of the genera Shewanella, Vibrio, Aliivibrio, Photobacterium, Pseudoalteromonas and Psychrobacter, including Photobacterium phosphoreum, Shewanella baltica and Pseudomonas fluorescens are unable to grow on PCA. APC analysis also confirmed that on plate count agar (PCA) the enumeration of the microbiota was underestimated. Although Long and Hammer agar (LH) and marine agar (MA) obtained the best quantitative (APC analysis) and qualitative (replication and DGGE analyses) results for fish quality analysis, analysts have to keep in mind that some species were also unable to grow on those media, such as Pseudomonas fragi and Acinetobacter sp.},

  Abstract                 = {16S rDNA clone library analysis was used to identify bacterial biodiversity in a variety of sea-ice microbial communities (SIMCO). DNA was extracted from seven Antarctic sea-ice samples and one Arctic sea-ice sample and 16S rDNA PCR-amplified using universal and Archaea-specific primers. Recombinant 16S rDNA clones were obtained and dereplicated using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (RFLP). After RFLP analysis, 100 distinct phylotypes (a unique clone or group of clones with sequence similarity of >0.98) were defined. From the clone libraries 16S rDNA sequences of bacterial and eukaryotic origin were detected, however Archaea were not detected either with universal or Archaea-specific 16S rDNA primer sets. Bacterial phylotypes grouped within the alpha and gamma proteobacteria, the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides division, the Gram-Positive bacteria and the orders Chlamydiales and Verrucomicrobiales. The majority of bacterial phylotypes were affiliated with heterotrophic taxa and many grouped closely with cultivated genera and species. Eukaryotic clones were affiliated with a variety of autotrophic and heterotrophic nanoplankton and included a large number of chloroplast 16S rDNA genes. The findings of this investigation corroborated culture data indicating bacterial biodiversity increased in SIMCO displaying high levels of primary production, however the bacterial communities within SIMCO were highly heterogeneous at the genus/species-level between different samples. A comparison of Antarctic and Arctic SIMCO revealed certain sea-ice dwelling bacterial genera are common at both poles.},

Conventional thought suggests that long-term incubations result in a culture collection enriched with species that are slow growing or rare, may be unavailable from short-term experiments, and likely are novel. However, after we examined the phylogenetic novelty of the isolates as a function of the time of their isolation, we found no correlation between the two. The probability of discovering either a new or rare species late in the incubation matched that of species isolated earlier. These outcomes are especially notable because of their generality: observations were essentially identical for marine and soil bacteria as well as for spore formers and non-spore formers. These findings are consistent with the idea of the stochastic awakening of dormant cells, thus lending support to the scout model. The process of microbial discovery is central to the study of environmental microorganisms and the human microbiome. While long-term incubation does not appear to increase the probability of discovering novel species, the technology enabling such incubations, i.e., single-cell cultivation, may still be the method of choice. While it does not necessarily allow more species to grow from a given inoculum, it minimizes the overall isolation effort and supplies needed.},

  Abstract                 = {The structure of bacterial communities in first-year spring and summer sea ice differs from that in source seawaters, suggesting selection during ice formation in autumn or taxon-specific mortality in the ice during winter. We tested these hypotheses by weekly sampling (January-March 2004) of first-year winter sea ice (Franklin Bay, Western Arctic) that experienced temperatures from -9 degrees C to -26 degrees C, generating community fingerprints and clone libraries for Bacteria and Archaea. Despite severe conditions and significant decreases in microbial abundance, no significant changes in richness or community structure were detected in the ice. Communities of Bacteria and Archaea in the ice, as in under-ice seawater, were dominated by SAR11 clade Alphaproteobacteria and Marine Group I Crenarchaeota, neither of which is known from later season sea ice. The bacterial ice library contained clones of Gammaproteobacteria from oligotrophic seawater clades (e.g. OM60, OM182) but no clones from gammaproteobacterial genera commonly detected in later season sea ice by similar methods (e.g. Colwellia, Psychrobacter). The only common sea ice bacterial genus detected in winter ice was Polaribacter. Overall, selection during ice formation and mortality during winter appear to play minor roles in the process of microbial succession that leads to distinctive spring and summer sea ice communities.},

  Abstract                 = {Although cyanobacterial diazotrophs are common in Arctic terrestrial and freshwater habitats, they have been assumed to be absent from Arctic marine habitats. We report here a high diversity of cyanobacterial nifH genes in Fram Strait and the Greenland Sea. The nifH gene encodes the iron protein of the nitrogenase enzyme complex, which is essential for biological N2 fixation. Using primers specific for nifH genes we uncovered communities of autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria in sea ice brine and seawater between latitudes 65 and 81°N. Cyanobacteria (Oscillatoriales and Chroococcales) with known marine planktonic and benthic distributions were distinguished, alongside a mix of metabolically versatile eubacteria (nifH Clusters I and III). Using primers selective for cyanobacterial nifH genes we identified filamentous non-heterocystous Trichodesmium-like and LPP (Leptolyngbya, Phormidium and Plectonema)-like Oscillatoriales, as well as Cyanothece-like Chroococcales in a brine sample from 81°N. The occurrence of Trichodesmium-like cyanobacteria was further confirmed by sequences of the hetR gene of Trichodesmium. Microscopic examinations confirmed the presence of viable filamentous and unicellular cyanobacteria. Our results reveal the potential for microbial N2 fixation in the Arctic seas. However, it is still left to determine if these genes are also metabolically active before any biogeochemical importance of diazotrophy in the polar oceans can be assessed.},

Our aim was to use a combination of molecular approaches, bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and immunocapture, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, and cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes to assess the composition of growing bacteria in Baltic Sea sediments. The study site was a highly polluted area off the Swedish coast. The sediments were sampled in two consecutive years, before and after remediation, by dredging of the top sediments. Levels of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), mercury, and polychlorinated biphenyls were dramatically reduced as a result of the cleanup project. The compositions of growing members of the communities were significantly different at the two sampling periods. In particular, members from the class Deltaproteobacteria and genus Spirochaeta were more dominant before dredging, but members of the classes Gammaproteobacteria and the Flavobacteria represented the most dominant growing populations after dredging. We also cultivated isolates from the polluted sediments that could transform the model PAH compound, phenanthrene. Some of these isolates were confirmed as dominant growing populations by the molecular methods as well. This suite of methods enabled us to link the identity and activity of the members of the sediment communities.},

  Abstract                 = {Sea ice is a highly dynamic and productive environment that includes a diverse array of psychrophilic prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxa distinct from the underlying water column. Because sea ice has only been extensive on Earth since the mid-Eocene, it has been hypothesized that bacteria highly adapted to inhabit sea ice have traits that have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Here we compared the genomes of the psychrophilic bacterium Psychroflexus torquis ATCC 700755(T), associated with both Antarctic and Arctic sea ice, and its closely related nonpsychrophilic sister species, P. gondwanensis ACAM 44(T). Results show that HGT has occurred much more extensively in P. torquis in comparison to P. gondwanensis. Genetic features that can be linked to the psychrophilic and sea ice-specific lifestyle of P. torquis include genes for exopolysaccharide (EPS) and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) biosynthesis, numerous specific modes of nutrient acquisition, and proteins putatively associated with ice-binding, light-sensing (bacteriophytochromes), and programmed cell death (metacaspases). Proteomic analysis showed that several genes associated with these traits are highly translated, especially those involved with EPS and PUFA production. Because most of the genes relating to the ability of P. torquis to dwell in sea-ice ecosystems occur on genomic islands that are absent in closely related P. gondwanensis, its adaptation to the sea-ice environment appears driven mainly by HGT. The genomic islands are rich in pseudogenes, insertional elements, and addiction modules, suggesting that gene acquisition is being followed by a process of genome reduction potentially indicative of evolving ecosystem specialism.},

However, little is known about the potential impact of accidental oil spills on this environment. We investigated the impact of crude oil on microbial community composition in six different Arctic sea-ice samples incubated with crude oil at 1 degrees C in microcosms for one year. Alterations in the composition of bacterial communities were analyzed with the culture-independent molecular methods DGGE (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) and FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization). DGGE, FISH and cultivation methods revealed a strong shift in community composition toward the gamma-proteobacteria in sea-ice and melt pool samples incubated with crude oil. Marinobacter spp., Shewanella spp. and Pseudomonas spp. were the predominant phylotypes in the oil-treated microcosms. The ability of indigenous sea-ice bacteria to degrade hydrocarbons at low temperature (1 degrees C) was tested using four representative strains cultivated from sea-ice enriched with crude oil. [14C]Hexadecane was degraded by the sea-ice isolates at 20-50\% capacity of the mesophilic type strain Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus, a known hydrocarbon degrader, incubated at 22 degrees C.},

  Abstract                 = {The diversity of culturable bacteria associated with sea ice from four permanently cold fjords of Spitzbergen, Arctic Ocean, was investigated. A total of 116 psychrophilic and psychrotolerant strains were isolated under aerobic conditions at 4 degrees C. The isolates were grouped using amplified rDNA restriction analysis fingerprinting and identified by partial sequencing of 16S rRNA gene. The bacterial isolates fell in five phylogenetic groups: subclasses alpha and gamma of Proteobacteria, the Bacillus-Clostridium group, the order Actinomycetales, and the Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides (CFB) phylum. Over 70\% of the isolates were affiliated with the Proteobacteria gamma subclass. Based on phylogenetic analysis (<98\% sequence similarity), over 40\% of Arctic isolates represent potentially novel species or genera. Most of the isolates were psychrotolerant and grew optimally between 20 and 25 degrees C. Only a few strains were psychrophilic, with an optimal growth at 10-15 degrees C. The majority of the bacterial strains were able to secrete a broad range of cold-active hydrolytic enzymes into the medium at a cultivation temperature of 4 degrees C. The isolates that are able to degrade proteins (skim milk, casein), lipids (olive oil), and polysaccharides (starch, pectin) account for, respectively, 56, 31, and 21\% of sea-ice and seawater strains. The temperature dependences for enzyme production during growth and enzymatic activity were determined for two selected enzymes, alpha-amylase and beta-galactosidase. Interestingly, high levels of enzyme productions were measured at growth temperatures between 4 and 10 degrees C, and almost no production was detected at higher temperatures (20-30 degrees C). Catalytic activity was detected even below the freezing point of water (at -5 degrees C), demonstrating the unique properties of these enzymes.},

  Abstract                 = {A fundamental question in microbial oceanography concerns the relationship between prokaryote diversity and biogeochemical function in an ecosystem context. We combined bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) magnetic bead immunocapture and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (BUMP-DGGE) to examine phylotype-specific growth in natural marine assemblages. We also examined a broad range of marine bacterial isolates to determine their abilities to incorporate BrdU in order to test the validity of the method for application to diverse marine assemblages. We found that 27 of 29 isolates belonging to different taxa could incorporate BrdU. BUMP-DGGE analysis revealed phylogenetic affiliations of DNA-synthesizing, presumably actively growing bacteria across a eutrophic to mesotrophic transect in the Inland Sea of Japan. We found that the BrdU-incorporating (growing) communities were substantially different from the total communities. The majority (34/56) of phylotypes incorporated BrdU and were presumably growing, and these phylotypes comprised 10 alphaproteobacteria, 1 betaproteobacterium, 11 gammaproteobacteria, 11 Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides group bacteria, and 1 unclassified bacterium. All BrdU-responsive alphaproteobacteria were members of the Rhodobacterales, suggesting that such bacteria were dominant in the growing alphaproteobacterial populations in our samples. The BrdU-responsive gammaproteobacteria belonged to the Oceanospirillales, the SAR86 cluster, the Pseudomonadales, the Alteromonadales, and the Vibrionales. Thus, contemporaneous cooccurrence of diverse actively growing bacterial taxa was a consistent pattern in our biogeochemically varied study area.},

Although the other four strains studied probably belong to this new species, DNA-DNA hybridization tests were not conducted. The closest phylogenetic relatives of P. vacuolata are the photosynthetic nonsulfur purple bacterium Rhodoferax fermentans and the hydrogen autotroph Variovorax paradoxus.},

  Abstract                 = {Heterotrophic bacteria in sea ice play a key role in carbon cycling, but little is known about the predominant players at the phylogenetic level. In a study of both algal bands and clear ice habitats within summertime Arctic pack ice from the Chukchi Sea, we determined the abundance of total bacteria and actively respiring cells in melted ice samples using epifluorescence microscopy and the stains 4', 6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole 2HCl (DAPI) and 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (CTC), respectively. Organic-rich and -poor culturing media were used to determine culturable members by plating (at 0 degrees C and 5 degrees C) and most-probable-number (MPN) analyses (at -1 degrees C). Total bacterial counts ranged from 5.44 x 10(4) ml(-1) in clear ice to 2.41 x 10(6) ml(-1) in algal-band ice samples, with 2-27\% metabolically active by CTC stain. Plating and MPN results revealed a high degree of culturability in both types of media, but greater success in oligotrophic media (to 62\% of total abundance) and from clear ice samples. The bacterial enumeration anomaly, commonly held to mean <or= 0.01\% cultured, was not demonstrated in any of our samples. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to check the purity of 44 isolates and select representatives for subsequent sequencing. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA sequences indicated close relationships exclusively to known marine psychrophiles within two bacterial divisions, Proteobacteria (in the genera Alteromonas, Colwellia, Glaciecola, Octadecabacter, Pseudoaltermonas and Shewanella) and Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides (Cytophaga, Flavobacterium, Gelidibacter and Polaribacter). All cultures from the clear ice sample with highest (62\%) culturability were closely related to each other or to psychrophilic Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides (94.9-99.6\% sequence similarities). Overall, these findings suggest limited, heterotrophic bacterial diversity at cold temperatures and may provide insight into the recent evolution of psychrophilic bacteria.},

  Abstract                 = {To investigate the responses of Baltic Sea wintertime bacterial communities to changing salinity (5 to 26 practical salinity units), an experimental study was conducted. Bacterial communities of Baltic seawater and sea ice from a coastal site in southwest Finland were used in two batch culture experiments run for 17 or 18 days at 0 degrees C. Bacterial abundance, cell volume, and leucine and thymidine incorporation were measured during the experiments. The bacterial community structure was assessed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR-amplified partial 16S rRNA genes with sequencing of DGGE bands from initial communities and communities of day 10 or 13 of the experiment. The sea ice-derived bacterial community was metabolically more active than the open-water community at the start of the experiment. Ice-derived bacterial communities were able to adapt to salinity change with smaller effects on physiology and community structure, whereas in the open-water bacterial communities, the bacterial cell volume evolution, bacterial abundance, and community structure responses indicated the presence of salinity stress. The closest relatives for all eight partial 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained were either organisms found in polar sea ice and other cold habitats or those found in summertime Baltic seawater. All sequences except one were associated with the alpha- and gamma-proteobacteria or the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides group. The overall physiological and community structure responses were parallel in ice-derived and open-water bacterial assemblages, which points to a linkage between community structure and physiology. These results support previous assumptions of the role of salinity fluctuation as a major selective factor shaping the sea ice bacterial community structure.},

  Abstract                 = {Proteorhodopsins (PRs) are widespread bacterial integral membrane proteins that function as light-driven proton pumps. Antarctic sea ice supports a complex community of autotrophic algae, heterotrophic bacteria, viruses, and protists that are an important food source for higher trophic levels in ice-covered regions of the Southern Ocean. Here, we present the first report of PR-bearing bacteria, both dormant and active, in Antarctic sea ice from a series of sites in the Ross Sea using gene-specific primers. Positive PR sequences were generated from genomic DNA at all depths in sea ice, and these sequences aligned with the classes Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Flavobacteria. The sequences showed some similarity to previously reported PR sequences, although most of the sequences were generally distinct. Positive PR sequences were also observed from cDNA reverse transcribed from RNA isolated from sea ice samples. This finding indicates that these sequences were generated from metabolically active cells and suggests that the PR gene is functional within sea ice. Both blue-absorbing and green-absorbing forms of PRs were detected, and only a limited number of blue-absorbing forms were found and were in the midsection of the sea ice profile in this study. Questions still remain regarding the protein's ecological functions, and ultimately, field experiments will be needed to establish the ecological and functional role of PRs in the sea ice ecosystem.},

Using a combination of primers for pufM (which encodes a pigment-binding protein subunit of the reaction centre complex), clone libraries of DNA and cDNA were created and a total of 63 positive clones were obtained from three sites, all clustering within the α-Proteobacteria. Fifty-three of these clones were from seawater. The remaining clones were from sea ice and all were found in the middle and bottom sections of the ice. These sea ice bacteria may favour the lower part of the ice matrix where irradiance is low.

  Abstract                 = {Two Gram-negative, motile, aerobic, catalase- and oxidase-positive, rod-shaped strains, designated ZS5-23(T) and ZS6-22(T), were respectively isolated from Antarctic coastal attached (fast) ice and surface seawater samples. Both strains could grow at 4-35 °C (optimum 30 °C) and in the absence of NaCl. Analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strains ZS5-23(T) and ZS6-22(T) were closely related to each other (99.0 \% sequence similarity) and belonged to the class Gammaproteobacteria, with their closest relatives being Spongiibacter and Melitea species (93.1-94.3 \% sequence similarity). The predominant cellular fatty acids in both strains were C₁₇:₁ω8c, C₁₇:₀ and summed feature 3 (C₁₆:₁ω7c and/or iso-C₁₅:₀ 2-OH). Genomic DNA G+C contents of strains ZS5-23(T) and ZS6-22(T) were 51.5 and 51.8 mol\%, respectively. The DNA-DNA relatedness between strains ZS5-23(T) and ZS6-22(T) was 50.9 \%. Strains ZS5-23(T) and ZS6-22(T) could be differentiated from each other and from Spongiibacter and Melitea species by differences in a number of phenotypic properties. Based on the data presented, strains ZS5-23(T) and ZS6-22(T) represent two novel species in a new genus in the class Gammaproteobacteria, for which the names Zhongshania antarctica gen. nov., sp. nov. (the type species) and Zhongshania guokunii sp. nov. are proposed. The type strain of Zhongshania antarctica is ZS5-23(T) ( = KACC 14066(T)  = CCTCC AB 209246(T)) and that of Zhongshania guokunii is ZS6-22(T) ( = KACC 14532(T)  = CCTCC AB 209247(T)).},

  Abstract                 = {The structure and ecological roles of the exopolysaccharides (EPSs) from sea ice microorganisms are poorly studied. Here we show that strain SM20310, with an EPS production of 567 mg liter(-1), was screened from 110 Arctic sea ice isolates and identified as a Pseudoalteromonas strain. The EPS secreted by SM20310 was purified, and its structural characteristics were studied. The predominant repeating unit of this EPS is a highly complicated α-mannan with a molecular mass greater than 2 × 10(6) Da. The backbone of the EPS consists of 2-α-, 6-α-mannosyl residues, in which a considerable part of the 6-α-mannosyl residues are branched at the 2 position with either single t-mannosyl residues or two mannosyl residues. The structure of the described EPS is different from the structures of EPSs secreted by other marine bacteria. Analysis of the ecological roles of the identified EPS showed that the EPS could significantly enhance the high-salinity tolerance of SM20310 and improve the survival of SM20310 after freeze-thaw cycles. These results suggest that the EPS secreted by strain SM20310 enables the strain to adapt to the sea ice environment, which is characterized by low temperature, high salinity, and repeated freeze-thaw cycles. In addition to its functions in strain SM20310, this EPS also significantly improved the tolerance of Escherichia coli to freeze-thaw cycles, suggesting that it may have a universal impact on microorganism cryoprotection.},

Bacteria were isolated from the melted sea ice samples and phages were screened from the same samples for 43 purified isolates. Plaque-producing phages were found for 15 bacterial isolates at 3 °C. Ten phage isolates were successfully plaque purified and eight of them were chosen for particle purification to analyze their morphology and structural proteins. Phage 1/32 infecting an isolate affiliated to phylum Bacteroidetes (Flavobacterium sp.) is a siphovirus and six phages infecting isolates affiliated to γ-Proteobacteria (Shewanella sp.) hosts were myoviruses. Cross titrations between the hosts showed that all studied phages are host specific. Phage solutions, host growth and phage infection were tested in different temperatures revealing phage temperature tolerance up to 45 °C, whereas phage infection was in most of the cases retarded above 15 °C. This study is the first to report isolation and cultivation of ice bacteria and cold-active phages from the Baltic Sea ice.},

  Abstract                 = {It is well-established that atmospheric deposition transports mercury from lower latitudes to the Arctic. The role of bacteria in the dynamics of the deposited mercury, however, is unknown. We characterized mercury-resistant bacteria from High Arctic snow, freshwater and sea-ice brine. Bacterial densities were 9.4 × 10(5), 5 × 10(5) and 0.9-3.1 × 10(3) cells mL(-1) in freshwater, brine and snow, respectively. Highest cultivability was observed in snow (11.9\%), followed by freshwater (0.3\%) and brine (0.03\%). In snow, the mercury-resistant bacteria accounted for up to 31\% of the culturable bacteria, but <2\% in freshwater and brine. The resistant bacteria belonged to the Alpha-, Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteriodetes. Resistance levels of most isolates were not temperature dependent. Of the resistant isolates, 25\% reduced Hg(II) to Hg(0). No relation between resistance level, ability to reduce Hg(II) and phylogenetic group was observed. An estimation of the potential bacterial reduction of Hg(II) in snow suggested that it was important in the deeper snow layers where light attenuation inhibited photoreduction. Thus, by reducing Hg(II) to Hg(0), mercury-resistant bacteria may limit the supply of substrate for methylation processes and, hence, contribute to lowering the risk that methylmercury is being incorporated into the Arctic food chains.},

  Abstract                 = {Bacterial reduction in Hg(2+) to Hg(0) , mediated by the mercuric reductase (MerA), is important in the biogeochemical cycling of Hg in temperate environments. Little is known about the occurrence and diversity of merA in the Arctic. Seven merA determinants were identified among bacterial isolates from High Arctic snow, freshwater and sea-ice brine. Three determinants in Bacteriodetes, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria showed < 92\% (amino acid) sequence similarity to known merA, while one merA homologue in Alphaproteobacteria and 3 homologues from Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria were > 99\% similar to known merA's. Phylogenetic analysis showed the Bacteroidetes merA to be part of an early lineage in the mer phylogeny, whereas the Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria merA appeared to have evolved recently. Several isolates, in which merA was not detected, were able to reduce Hg(2+) , suggesting presence of unidentified merA genes. About 25\% of the isolates contained plasmids, two of which encoded mer operons. One plasmid was a broad host-range IncP-α plasmid. No known incompatibility group could be assigned to the others. The presence of conjugative plasmids, and an incongruent distribution of merA within the taxonomic groups, suggests horizontal transfer of merA as a likely mechanism for High Arctic microbial communities to adapt to changing mercury concentration.},

DNA-DNA hybridization analysis indicated the presence of two distinct and novel genospecies each isolated from a different Antarctic habitat. From polyphasic taxonomic data it is proposed that the two groups represent new species with the following proposed names: Flavobacterium gillisiae (ACAM 601T) and Flavobacterium tegetincola (ACAM 602T). In addition polyphasic analysis of the species '[Cytophaga] xantha' (Inoue and Komagata 1976), isolated from Antarctic mud, indicated it was a distinct member of the genus Flavobacterium and was thus revived as Flavobacterium xanthum. Phylogenetic and fatty acid analyses also indicate that the species [Flavobacterium] salegens (Dobson et al. 1993), from Organic Lake, Antarctica, is misclassified at the genus level.

  Abstract                 = {Marine bacterioplanktons are thought to play a vital role in Southern Ocean ecology and ecosystem function, as they do in other ocean systems. However, our understanding of phylogenetic diversity, genome-enabled capabilities and specific adaptations to this persistently cold environment is limited. Bacterioplankton community composition shifts significantly over the annual cycle as sea ice melts and phytoplankton bloom. Microbial diversity in sea ice is better known than that of the plankton, where culture collections do not appear to represent organisms detected with molecular surveys. Broad phylogenetic groupings of Antarctic bacterioplankton such as the marine group I Crenarchaeota, alpha-Proteobacteria (Roseobacter-related and SAR-11 clusters), gamma-Proteobacteria (both cultivated and uncultivated groups) and Bacteriodetes-affiliated organisms in Southern Ocean waters are in common with other ocean systems. Antarctic SSU rRNA gene phylotypes are typically affiliated with other polar sequences. Some species such as Polaribacter irgensii and currently uncultivated gamma-Proteobacteria (Ant4D3 and Ant10A4) may flourish in Antarctic waters, though further studies are needed to address diversity on a larger scale. Insights from initial genomics studies on both cultivated organisms and genomes accessed through shotgun cloning of environmental samples suggest that there are many unique features of these organisms that facilitate survival in high-latitude, persistently cold environments.},

  Abstract                 = {Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are macromolecules produced by bacteria as means for storing carbon and energy in intracellular granules. PHAs have physical properties similar to those of plastics and have become of interest to industry as materials for environmentally friendly bioplastic production. There is an ongoing search for new PHA-producing bacterial strains and PHA-synthesizing enzymes tolerating extreme conditions to find ways of producing PHAs at cold temperatures and high solute concentrations. Moreover, the study of PHA producers in the sea-ice biome can aid in understanding the microbial ecology of carbon cycling in ice-associated ecosystems. In this study, PHA producers and PHA synthase genes were examined under the extreme environmental conditions of sea ice and cold seawater to find evidence of PHA production in an environment requiring adaptation to high salinity and cold temperatures. Sea ice and cold estuarine water samples were collected from the northern Baltic Sea and evidence of PHA production was gathered, using microscopy with Nile Blue A staining of PHA-granules and PCR assays detecting PHA-synthesis genes. The PHA granules and PHA synthases were found at all sampling locations, in both sea ice and water, and throughout the sampling period spanning over 10 years. Our study shows, for the first time, that PHA synthesis occurs in Baltic Sea cold-adapted bacteria in their natural environment, which makes the Baltic Sea and its cold environments an interesting choice in the quest for PHA-synthesizing bacteria and synthesis genes.},

  Abstract                 = {The contamination of polar regions due to the global distribution of anthropogenic pollutants is of great concern because it leads to the bioaccumulation of toxic substances, methylmercury among them, in Arctic food chains. Here we present the first evidence that microbes in the high Arctic possess and express diverse merA genes, which specify the reduction of ionic mercury [Hg(II)] to the volatile elemental form [Hg(0)]. The sampled microbial biomass, collected from microbial mats in a coastal lagoon and from the surface of marine macroalgae, was comprised of bacteria that were most closely related to psychrophiles that had previously been described in polar environments. We used a kinetic redox model, taking into consideration photoredox reactions as well as mer-mediated reduction, to assess if the potential for Hg(II) reduction by Arctic microbes can affect the toxicity and environmental mobility of mercury in the high Arctic. Results suggested that mer-mediated Hg(II) reduction could account for most of the Hg(0) that is produced in high Arctic waters. At the surface, with only 5\% metabolically active cells, up to 68\% of the mercury pool was resolved by the model as biogenic Hg(0). At a greater depth, because of incident light attenuation, the significance of photoredox transformations declined and merA-mediated activity could account for up to 90\% of Hg(0) production. These findings highlight the importance of microbial redox transformations in the biogeochemical cycling, and thus the toxicity and mobility, of mercury in polar regions.},

  Abstract                 = {Pseudoalteromonas sp. SM9913 is a psychrotolerant bacterium isolated from deep-sea sediment. The structural characterization and ecological roles of the exopolysaccharide (EPS) secreted by this strain were studied in this work. The yield of the EPS increased as the culture temperature decreased in the range 30-10 degrees C, and it reached 5.25 g l(-1) (dry weight) under optimal growth conditions (15 degrees C, 52 h). EPS fraction was purified and its structure was identified by the combination of NMR spectra, high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) analysis and methylation analysis. The ratio of the sugar units, the acetyl group and the ethoxyl group was close to 4 : 5 : 1. The major sugar unit of the EPS was 6-linked glucose (61.8 \%); other sugar units present included terminal arabinofuranosyl (11.0 \%) and glucopyranosyl (11.2 \%) residues and a small amount of other sugar derivatives. Its structure was different from EPSs reported for other marine bacteria. Besides the structural elucidation of the EPS, its ecological roles were studied. This EPS could enhance the stability of the cold-adapted protease MCP-01 secreted by the same strain through preventing its autolysis. It could bind many metal ions, including Fe(2+), Zn(2+), Cu(2+), Co(2+). It was also a very good flocculating agent and could conglomerate colloidal and suspended particles. These results indicated that the EPS secreted by strain SM9913 might help this strain enrich the proteinaceous particles and the trace metals in the deep-sea environment, stabilize the secreted cold-adapted proteases and avoid its diffusion. This is believed to be the first report on the structure of the EPS secreted by a deep-sea psychrotolerant bacterium and its ecological roles. According to these results and other studies, a schematic diagram of the lifestyle of the deep-sea psychrotolerant strain SM9913 is suggested.},

With many new bacterial genera and species being isolated from marine environments, this question warrants attention. In this study, we sequenced all the type strains of the published species of Glaciecola, a recently defined cold-adapted genus with species from diverse marine locations, to study the genomic diversity and cold-adaptation strategy in this genus.The genome size diverged widely from 3.08 to 5.96 Mb, which can be explained by massive gene gain and loss events. Horizontal gene transfer and new gene emergence contributed substantially to the genome size expansion. The genus Glaciecola had an open pan-genome. Comparative genomic research indicated that species of the genus Glaciecola had high diversity in genome size, gene content and genetic relatedness. This may be prevalent in marine bacterial genera considering the dynamic and complex environments of the ocean. Species of Glaciecola had some common genomic features related to cold adaptation, which enable them to thrive and play a role in biogeochemical cycle in the cold marine environments.},

The active substance was identified as a approximately 25-kDa protein that was purified through its affinity for ice. The full gene sequence was determined and was found to encode a 253-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 26,350 Da. The predicted amino acid sequence is similar to predicted sequences of ice-binding proteins recently found in two species of sea ice diatoms and a species of snow mold. A recombinant ice-binding protein showed ice-binding activity and ice recrystallization inhibition activity. The protein is much smaller than bacterial ice-nucleating proteins and antifreeze proteins that have been previously described. The function of the protein is unknown but it may act as an ice recrystallization inhibitor to protect membranes in the frozen state.},

  Abstract                 = {<p>Diatoms and other algae not only survive, but thrive in sea ice. Among sea ice diatoms, all species examined so far produce ice-binding proteins (IBPs), whereas no such proteins are found in non-ice-associated diatoms, which strongly suggests that IBPs are essential for survival in ice. The restricted occurrence also raises the question of how the IBP genes were acquired. Proteins with similar sequences and ice-binding activities are produced by ice-associated bacteria, and so it has previously been speculated that the genes were acquired by horizontal transfer (HGT) from bacteria. Here we report several new IBP sequences from three types of ice algae, which together with previously determined sequences reveal a phylogeny that is completely incongruent with algal phylogeny, and that can be most easily explained by HGT. HGT is also supported by the finding that the closest matches to the algal IBP genes are all bacterial genes and that the algal IBP genes lack introns. We also describe a highly freeze-tolerant bacterium from the bottom layer of Antarctic sea ice that produces an IBP with 47% amino acid identity to a diatom IBP from the same layer, demonstrating at least an opportunity for gene transfer. Together, these results suggest that the success of diatoms and other algae in sea ice can be at least partly attributed to their acquisition of prokaryotic IBP genes.</p>},

  Abstract                 = {Eleven psychrophilic bacteria were isolated from a solid layer of fast ice in the middle of Pointe-Geologie Archipelago, Adelie Land, Antarctica. The 11 isolates based on the phenotypic characteristics, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic analysis have been identified as members of the genus Halomonas. All the isolates at the 16S rDNA sequence level were identical, possessed the 15 conserved nucleotides of the family Halomonadaceae and four nucleotides of the genus Halomonas. Therefore, the 16S rDNA sequence of DD 39 was used for calculating the evolutionary distances and for phylogenetic analysis. It was observed that DD 39 formed a robust cluster with H. variabilis, from which it differed by 0.7\%. Further DNA-DNA hybridization studies indicated low DNA-DNA homology (15\%) between H. variabilis and DD 39. Between the 11 Antarctic isolates the homology was >85\%. In addition it was observed that DD 39 was different from H. variabilis in that it was psychrophilic, could tolerate only up to 15\% sodium chloride, could not hydrolyse esculin, could not reduce nitrate, was urease negative, could not utilize glycerol as a carbon source, and was resistant to ampicillin and erythromycin and sensitive to nalidixic acid. In addition, it also exhibited distinct differences with respect to high content of C(16:1) and low levels of cyclo-C(17:0) and cyclo-C(19:0). DD 39 also differed from all the other reported species of Halomonas with respect to many phenotypic characteristics. It is proposed therefore that DD 39 should be placed in the genus Halomonas as a new species that is Halomonas glaciei. The type strain of H. glaciei is DD 39(T) (MTCC 4321; JCM 11692).},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:The genome sequence of the sea-ice bacterium Psychromonas ingrahamii 37, which grows exponentially at -12C, may reveal features that help to explain how this extreme psychrophile is able to grow at such low temperatures. Determination of the whole genome sequence allows comparison with genes of other psychrophiles and mesophiles.RESULTS:Correspondence analysis of the composition of all P. ingrahamii proteins showed that (1) there are 6 classes of proteins, at least one more than other bacteria, (2) integral inner membrane proteins are not sharply separated from bulk proteins suggesting that, overall, they may have a lower hydrophobic character, and (3) there is strong opposition between asparagine and the oxygen-sensitive amino acids methionine, arginine, cysteine and histidine and (4) one of the previously unseen clusters of proteins has a high proportion of "orphan" hypothetical proteins, raising the possibility these are cold-specific proteins.Based on annotation of proteins by sequence similarity, (1) P. ingrahamii has a large number (61) of regulators of cyclic GDP, suggesting that this bacterium produces an extracellular polysaccharide that may help sequester water or lower the freezing point in the vicinity of the cell. (2) P. ingrahamii has genes for production of the osmolyte, betaine choline, which may balance the osmotic pressure as sea ice freezes. (3) P. ingrahamii has a large number (11) of three-subunit TRAP systems that may play an important role in the transport of nutrients into the cell at low temperatures. (4) Chaperones and stress proteins may play a critical role in transforming nascent polypeptides into 3-dimensional configurations that permit low temperature growth. (5) Metabolic properties of P. ingrahamii were deduced. Finally, a few small sets of proteins of unknown function which may play a role in psychrophily have been singled out as worthy of future study.CONCLUSION:The results of this genomic analysis provide a springboard for further investigations into mechanisms of psychrophily. Focus on the role of asparagine excess in proteins, targeted phenotypic characterizations and gene expression investigations are needed to ascertain if and how the organism regulates various proteins in response to growth at lower temperatures.},

These strains displayed the general chemotaxonomic and phenotypic features of members of the genus Psychrobacter. 16S rRNA gene sequencing positioned the three isolates KMM 3646T, KMM 3643 and KMM 3645 and isolate KMM 3659T in two distinct lineages within the genus Psychrobacter, displaying less than 98.5 \% sequence similarity to the type strains of other Psychrobacter species. Genomic distinctness was supported by phenotypic differences in growth temperatures, salinity range for growth and metabolic properties. Based on a combination of phenotypic and biochemical characteristics and phylogenetic position, it is proposed that the members of these two distinct lineages represent two novel species, for which the names Psychrobacter maritimus sp. nov. (type strain Pi2-20T = KMM 3646T = DSM 15387T) and Psychrobacter arenosus sp. nov. (type strain R7T = KMM 3659T = DSM 15389T) are proposed.},

Comparative analyses based on the 16S rRNA and recA gene sequences placed strain KMM 3858(T) within the genus Pseudochrobactrum. The major chemotaxonomic characteristics were found to be the presence of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, an unknown aminolipid and phosphatidylcholine, major fatty acids C(18 : 1)omega7c and C(19 : 0) cyclo, and ubiquinone Q-10, confirming the affiliation of strain KMM 3858(T) to the genus Pseudochrobactrum. On the basis of the phylogenetic analysis and the physiological and biochemical characterization, strain KMM 3858(T) should be classified as representing a novel species of the genus Pseudochrobactrum, for which the name Pseudochrobactrum glaciei sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is strain Pi26(T) (=KMM 3858(T)=NRIC 0733(T)=JCM 15115(T)).},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of the study was to survey cultivable heterotrophic bacteria from sea ice samples collected from Peter the Great Bay of the Sea of Japan, and to test the isolates for antagonistic activity. A total of 195 strains were isolated and investigated by a phenotypic approach. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis of thirty eight strains revealed primarily representatives of the class Gammaproteobacteria, phylum Bacteroidetes, and phylum Actinobacteria. Members of the class Alphaproteobacteria were a minor component. Most strains shared 98-99\% sequence similarity to recognized species, including those recovered previously from Antarctic or Arctic sea ice or polar environments, Shewanella frigidimarina, Psychrobacter urativorans, Psychrobacter glacincola, Psychrobacter fozii, Pseudomonas veronii, or Pseudomonas proteolytica. At least seven bacterial groups may represent novel species within known genera. Five isolates have been previously described as the novel species Marinomonas primoryensis and Psychrobacter maritimus. Antagonistic activity assays revealed a number of strains-antagonists of the Pseudomonas fluorescens group, Bacillus and Nocardioides displaying remarkable antifungal and antibacterial activities. For the first time our findings show that sea ice offshore in the Sea of Japan represents an untapped source of bacterial biodiversity and microorganisms capable of antibacterial and antifungal metabolite production.},

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, this isolate was identified as a species of the genus Pseudomonas under the P. fluorescens group. The cloning of a 816 bp fragment of TIM gene which covers the 756 bp open reading frame was achieved by a combination of degenerate and splinkerette PCRs. The partial sequence of this gene was first PCR amplified by using degenerate primers and the flanking sequences were subsequently amplified by splinkerette PCR technique. Amino acid sequence of the cloned TIM was 97\% identical to TIM from Pseudomonas fluorescens and shared 51\% identity with the TIM from psychrophilic Vibrio sp. This work demonstrated the use of multiple PCR techniques to clone a gene without prior knowledge of its sequence. The cloning of the TIM gene by PCR was more rapid and cost effective compared to the traditional genomic library construction and screening method. Homology model of the TIM protein in this study was generated based on Escherichia coli TIM crystal structure. The model could serve as a hypothetical TIM structure from a psychrophilic microorganism for further investigation into areas that showed deviations from the known mesophilic TIM structures.},

  Abstract                 = {Bacterioplankton phylotypes of alpha-Proteobacteria have been detected in various marine regions, but systematic biogeographical studies of their global distribution are missing. Alpha-Proteobacteria comprise one of the largest fractions of heterotrophic marine bacteria and include two clades, SAR11 and Roseobacter, which account for 26 and 16\% of 16S ribosomal RNA gene clones retrieved from marine bacterioplankton. The SAR11 clade attracted much interest because related 16S rRNA gene clones were among the first groups of marine bacteria to be identified by cultivation-independent approaches and appear to dominate subtropical surface bacterioplankton communities. Here we report on the global distribution of a newly discovered cluster affiliated to the Roseobacter clade, comprising only as-yet-uncultured phylotypes. Bacteria of this cluster occur from temperate to polar regions with highest abundance in the Southern Ocean, but not in tropical and subtropical regions. Between the south Atlantic subtropical front and Antarctica, we detected two distinct phylotypes, one north and one south of the polar front, indicating that two adjacent but different oceanic provinces allow the persistence of distinct but closely related phylotypes. These results suggest that the global distribution of major marine bacterioplankton components is related to oceanic water masses and controlled by their environmental and biogeochemical properties.},

In this study, we sequenced the complete genomes of six earlier reported phage isolates from the Baltic Sea ice infecting Shewanella sp. and Flavobacterium sp. hosts as well as characterized the phage-host interactions. Based on the genome sequences, the six phages were classified into five new genera. Only two phages, 1/4 and 1/40, both infecting Shewanella sp. strains, showed significant nucleotide sequence similarity to each other and could be grouped into the same genus. These two phages are also related to Vibrio-specific phages sharing approximately 25\% of the predicted gene products. Nevertheless, cross-titrations showed that the cold-active phages studied are host specific: none of the seven additionally tested, closely related Shewanella strains served as hosts for the phages. Adsorption experiments of two Shewanella phages, 1/4 and 3/49, conducted at 4°C and at 15°C revealed relatively fast adsorption rates that are, for example, comparable with those of phages infective in mesophilic conditions. Despite the small number of Shewanella phages characterized here, we could already find different types of phage-host interactions including a putative abortive infection.},

The open reading frame of PsGST comprised 654 bp encoding a protein of 217 amino acids with a calculated molecular size of 24.3 kDa. The rPsGST possesses the conserved amino acid defining the binding sites of glutathione (G-site) and substrate binding pocket (H-site) in GST N_3 family. PsGST was expressed in E. coli and the recombinant PsGST (rPsGST) was purified by Ni-affinity chromatography with a high specific activity of 74.21 U/mg. The purified rPsGST showed maximum activity at 40 °C and exhibited 14.2\% activity at 0 °C. It was completely inactivated at 50 °C for 40 min. These results indicated that rPsGST was a typical cold active GST with low thermostability. The enzyme was little affected by H2O2 and Triton X-100, and 50.2\% of the remaining activity was detected in the presence of high salt concentrations (2M NaCl). The enzymatic Km values for CDNB and GSH was 0.22 mM and 1.01 mM, respectively. These specific enzyme properties may be related to the survival environment of Antarctic sea ice bacteria.},

  Abstract                 = {<p>The genus <italic>Octadecabacter</italic> is a member of the ubiquitous marine <italic>Roseobacter</italic> clade. The two described species of this genus, <italic>Octadecabacter arcticus</italic> and <italic>Octadecabacter antarcticus</italic>, are psychrophilic and display a bipolar distribution. Here we provide the manually annotated and finished genome sequences of the type strains <italic>O. arcticus</italic> 238 and <italic>O. antarcticus</italic> 307, isolated from sea ice of the Arctic and Antarctic, respectively. Both genomes exhibit a high genome plasticity caused by an unusually high density and diversity of transposable elements. This could explain the discrepancy between the low genome synteny and high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between both strains. Numerous characteristic features were identified in the <italic>Octadecabacter</italic> genomes, which show indications of horizontal gene transfer and may represent specific adaptations to the habitats of the strains. These include a gene cluster encoding the synthesis and degradation of cyanophycin in <italic>O. arcticus</italic> 238, which is absent in <italic>O. antarcticus</italic> 307 and unique among the <italic>Roseobacter</italic> clade. Furthermore, genes representing a new subgroup of xanthorhodopsins as an adaptation to icy environments are present in both <italic>Octadecabacter</italic> strains. This new xanthorhodopsin subgroup differs from the previously characterized xanthorhodopsins of <italic>Salinibacter ruber</italic> and <italic>Gloeobacter violaceus</italic> in phylogeny, biogeography and the potential to bind 4-keto-carotenoids. Biochemical characterization of the <italic>Octadecabacter</italic> xanthorhodopsins revealed that they function as light-driven proton pumps.</p>},

The overall purification based on lipase activity was 27.5-fold with a yield of 25.4 \%. The purified lipase showed as a single band on SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular weight of 37 kDa. The optimum temperature and pH were 35 °C and 7.0, respectively. The lipase activity was enhanced by Ca(2+) and Mg(2+), while was partially inhibited by other metals such as Cu(2+), Zn(2+), Ba(2+), Pb(2+), Fe(2+) and Mn(2+). The lipase had high tolerance to a wide range of NaCl concentrations (0-2 M NaCl). It exhibited high levels of activity in the presence of DTT, Thiourea, H(2)O(2) as well as in the presence of various detergents such as Span 60, Tween-80, Triton X-100. In addition, the lipase showed a preference for long-chain p-nitrophenyl esters (C(12)-C(18)). These results indicated that this lipase could be a novel cold-active lipase.},

  Abstract                 = {Increased conformational flexibility is the prevailing explanation for the high catalytic efficiency of cold-adapted enzymes at low temperatures. However, less is known about the structural determinants of flexibility. We reported two novel cold-adapted zinc metalloproteases in the thermolysin family, vibriolysin MCP-02 from a deep sea bacterium and vibriolysin E495 from an Arctic sea ice bacterium, and compared them with their mesophilic homolog, pseudolysin from a terrestrial bacterium. Their catalytic efficiencies, k(cat)/K(m) (10-40 degrees C), followed the order pseudolysin < MCP-02 < E495 with a ratio of approximately 1:2:4. MCP-02 and E495 have the same optimal temperature (T(opt), 57 degrees C, 5 degrees C lower than pseudolysin) and apparent melting temperature (T(m) = 64 degrees C, approximately 10 degrees C lower than pseudolysin). Structural analysis showed that the slightly lower stabilities resulted from a decrease in the number of salt bridges. Fluorescence quenching experiments and molecular dynamics simulations showed that the flexibilities of the proteins were pseudolysin < MCP-02 < E495, suggesting that optimization of flexibility is a strategy for cold adaptation. Molecular dynamics results showed that the ordinal increase in flexibility from pseudolysin to MCP-02 and E495, especially the increase from MCP-02 to E495, mainly resulted from the decrease of hydrogen-bond stability in the dynamic structure, which was due to the increase in asparagine, serine, and threonine residues. Finally, a model for the cold adaptation of MCP-02 and E495 was proposed. This is the first report of the optimization of hydrogen-bonding dynamics as a strategy for cold adaptation and provides new insights into the structural basis underlying conformational flexibility.},

However, there are no data on PR proton pump activities in native marine bacteria. Here, we demonstrate light-driven proton pump activity (c. 124 H(+) PR(-1)  min(-1) ) in recently isolated marine Flavobacteria. Among 75 isolates, 38 possessed the PR gene. Illumination of cell suspensions from all eight tested strains in five genera triggered marked pH drops. The action spectrum of proton pump activity closely matched the spectral distribution of the sea surface green light field. Addition of hydroxylamine to a solubilized membrane fraction shifted the spectrum to a form characteristic of PR photobleached into retinal oxime, indicating that PRs in flavobacterial cell membranes transform the photon dose in incident radiation into energy in the form of membrane potential. Our results revealed that PR-mediated proton transport can create the sufficient membrane potential for the ATP synthesis in native flavobacterial cells.},

Strain 328(T) was able to grow at 0-37 degrees C, with optimum growth at 25-27 degrees C. It possessed phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol as major phospholipids and C(10 : 0) 3-OH (31.78 \%), C(18 : 1)omega7c (27.50 \%) and iso-C(15 : 0) 2-OH and/or C(16 : 1)omega7c (19.22 \%) as predominant cellular fatty acids. The DNA G+C content of strain 328(T) was 45.2 mol\%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain 328(T) was a member of the genus Marinomonas (92.7-96.0 \% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic distinctiveness, strain 328(T) was considered to represent a novel species of the genus Marinomonas. The name Marinomonas arctica sp. nov. is proposed, with strain 328(T) (=CGMCC 1.6498(T)=JCM 14976(T)) as the type strain.},

  Abstract                 = {A novel bacterial strain, designated 170(T), was collected from high latitude Arctic locations (77 degrees 30' N to approximately 81 degrees 12' N), including the Canadian Basin and Greenland Sea. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons showed that strain 170(T) was related to members of the genus Glaciecola and had the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to Glaciecola mesophila. Cells were Gram-negative, psychrophilic, motile rods. The temperature range for growth was 4-15 degrees C, with optimum growth at 12 degrees C and at approximately pH 6.0-9.0. Strain 170(T) contained C(16 : 1)omega7c, C(16 : 0), C(12 : 1) 3-OH and C(18 : 1)omega7c as major fatty acids. The genomic DNA G+C content was 42.9 mol\%. On the basis of phenotypic characterization, phylogenetic analysis and DNA-DNA relatedness data, strain 170(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Glaciecola, for which the name Glaciecola psychrophila is proposed. The type strain is 170(T) (=CGMCC 1.6130(T)=JCM 13954(T)).},
